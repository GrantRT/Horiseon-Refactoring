# Horiseon Refactoring

## Introduction

I was given the task to refactor existing code to follow accessibility standards and to make the site optimised for search engines.

## Technology used

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Summary

To achieve the task I applied the following changes:

- Added a suitable and concise title.
- Refactored div tags to semantic tags where possible.
- Formatted a re-ordered the HTML & CSS to follow a logical structure and flow.
- Added ALT attributes to all images and icons and a title to the Hero image.
- Refactored the heading attributes to fall in sequential order.
- Refactored the navbar so that all links are functioning correctly.
- Added appropriate comments to HTML and CSS.
- Streamlined the CSS to remove unnecessary classes where duplicated styles were applied.
